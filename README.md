## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo

You are free to fork and use parts of the code used to build this website **with attribution**.
I value keeping my code open-source, but I've had personal projects **completely cloned** and reused without attribution some times before and it's not a good feeling.

This is not a Gatsby template, nor it should be used as one. If you have any questions about implementations, refer to the [Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

## ðŸš€ Contributing

Feel free to contribute with a new feature, tackle an open issue or add corrections to previously published blog posts (already published articles are public as Markdown files in the content folder):

1. Fork this repository;
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`;
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'feat: add some feature'`;
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin new-feature`.

**After your pull request is merged**, you can safely delete your branch.
