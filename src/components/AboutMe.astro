          Create solutions, craft web experiences with care, explore design, UX
          and interactivity. My main goal in any project is to build and
          implement elegant and functional solutions that meet the needs of
          users while staying true to the crafterâ€™s vision.

          I started out focusing exclusively on solving frontend problems, but
          nowadays I do find myself constantly jumping between <b>design</b>, <b
            >frontend</b
          >
          and <b>backend</b> engineering tasks. I specially like working with <b
            >design systems</b
          >, and have a keen interest in building <b
            >backends with serverless architectures</b
