      Hello, Iâ€™m Ernesto, a software engineer from Brazil who has been working
      with the web platform since 2019.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-8">
      I started out focusing exclusively on solving frontend problems, but
      nowadays I do find myself constantly jumping between <b>design</b>, <b
        >frontend</b
      > and
      <b>backend</b> engineering tasks. I specially like working with design systems,
      and have a keen interest in building backends with serverless architectures
      in mind.
