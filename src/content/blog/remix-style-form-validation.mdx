**The Astro 1.0 Beta is now available!** This release marks the stabilization of all major APIs, with no more major breaking changes planned between now and the official v1.0 release.

In addition, we are thrilled to announce that the **official Astro v1.0.0 release will be available on June 8, 2022.** We plan to use these next two months to improve documentation, squash bugs, collect your feedback, and finish up [a few final Astro improvements](https://github.com/withastro/rfcs/discussions/161).
